1.  Exception classes allow you to define custom 
    types of exceptions that can be thrown and caught in your code.

2.  Your exception class should have at least one constructor that takes one or more arguments that describe the details of the exception,
    and may also have other methods that allow the exception to be examined or manipulated.


EX01

Main Idea:
The bureaucrats (employees) try to sign forms (documents).
Whether the form gets signed depends on the bureaucrat's grade (authority).
If the bureaucrat doesn’t have enough authority, the form can’t be signed.
Why the Exercise is Useful:
This exercise helps you understand:

Encapsulation (hiding internal details like the form’s grade requirements).
Exception handling (throwing errors if something goes wrong, like if a bureaucrat can’t sign a form).
Object relationships (how one object, a Bureaucrat, interacts with another object, a Form).
