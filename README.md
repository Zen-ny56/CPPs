📘 C++ Modules (00 - 09)
This project is a deep dive into modern C++ programming, completed as part of the 42 School curriculum. Each module builds on core C++ concepts, progressively developing skills in object-oriented design, memory management, polymorphism, templates, the Standard Template Library (STL), and more.

Module | Topic | Description
00 | 🧱 Basics of OOP | Introduction to classes, objects, namespaces, and member functions.
01 | 📁 Memory & I/O | Dynamic memory allocation, file streams, and reference handling.
02 | ➕ Operator Overloading | Polymorphism and customizing operators for classes.
03 | 🧬 Inheritance | Access specifiers, class hierarchy, and code reuse.
04 | 🧩 Abstract Classes | Runtime polymorphism and virtual functions.
05 | 🚨 Exception Handling | Safe and structured error control with custom exceptions.
06 | 🌀 Casting | Exploring C++ casts: static, dynamic, const, reinterpret.
07 | 🔣 Templates | Writing generic and reusable code via function/class templates.
08 | 🧺 STL & Algorithms | Working with vector, map, and STL algorithms.
09 | 🧠 Advanced Generics | High-level generic programming with STL containers and iterators.
