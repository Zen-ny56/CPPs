📘 C++ Modules (00 - 09)
This project is a deep dive into modern C++ programming, completed as part of the 42 School curriculum.
Each module builds upon core C++ concepts, progressively developing skills in:

- Object-Oriented Design

- Memory Management

- Polymorphism

- Templates

- The Standard Template Library (STL)
  
And much more

Module  |   Topic   |  Description

00 |     🧱 Basics of OOP    |  Introduction to classes, objects, namespaces, and member functions.

01 |     📁 Memory & I/O     |  Dynamic memory allocation, file streams, and reference handling.

02 | ➕ Operator Overloading |  Polymorphism and customizing operators for user-defined types.

03 |    🧬 Inheritance       |  Access specifiers, class hierarchy, and code reuse.

04 |   🧩 Abstract Classes   |  Runtime polymorphism and pure virtual functions.

05 |  🚨 Exception Handling  |  Safe and structured error control with try/catch blocks and custom exceptions.

06 |       🌀 Casting        |  Exploring static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast.

07 |     🔣 Templates        |  Writing generic and reusable code via function and class templates.

08 |   🧺 STL & Algorithms   |  Working with containers like vector, map, and standard STL algorithms.

09 |   🧠 Advanced Generics  |  High-level generic programming and advanced use of STL iterators and algorithms.
